# Prometheus
Prometheus is primarily an early-stage interactive application and rendering engine for Windows. Currently not much is implemented.

## Getting Started
Visuial Studio 2017 or 2019 is recommended, Prometheus is officially untested on other development enviroments.

You can clone the repository to a local destination using git:

`git clone --recursive https://github.com/LarsBuecker/Prometheus`

Make sure that you do a `--recursive` clone to fetch all of the submodules!
